# nextbillion-mcp

The [NextBillion.ai](https://nextbillion.ai) MCP server: geocoding, place search, routing,
distance matrices, isochrones, static maps and the product documentation as tools for AI
agents. It runs as a **hosted service at https://mcp.nextbillion.io** — add the URL to your
MCP client and sign in with your NextBillion.ai API key in the browser. Nothing is installed
locally.

Implements the [MCP 2026-07-28 specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28)
(stateless core, Streamable HTTP, OAuth 2.1) via the official TypeScript SDK v2; older-protocol
clients are served through the SDK's built-in legacy negotiation.

## Quick start

Get an API key from [console.nextbillion.ai](https://console.nextbillion.ai) or by emailing
support@nextbillion.ai, then connect your client:

| Scripts / CI                       | send the key directly: `--header "Authorization: Bearer $NBAI_API_KEY"`                                                                                                                                                                           |

The browser sign-in page asks for your API key once. Without signing in you can already list
the tools and use the four documentation tools; the first API tool call triggers the sign-in.

Tool inputs always use explicit `{latitude, longitude}` objects; the server handles the
underlying API's coordinate-order conventions internally.

### Documentation tools

Four tools answer questions about the APIs and SDKs from the official documentation: `search_documentation` returns ranked excerpts with a `source_url` to cite and the name of the tool that performs the operation, `get_documentation` returns one page or one section, `get_api_parameters` returns the request parameters of a REST endpoint as structured records (units only when the docs state them), and `list_documentation_topics` lists what is covered. The hosted server builds its index from the documentation repository at start and rebuilds it whenever the repository's `main` branch changes, so documentation updates reach it within minutes; the local package carries a snapshot built at release time (see `packages/server/docs/README.md`). Pages that exist on the site but not in the docs repository (solutions, apps, help, the Web Maps SDK v1) are not covered.

## How the hosted server works

- **The MCP endpoint is the root** of `https://mcp.nextbillion.io` (also the OAuth `resource`).
  `GET /health` answers liveness and reports the documentation index in use;
  `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` serve
  OAuth discovery.
- **Credentials travel with each request.** There is no server-wide key: every API call uses
  the key of the caller, sealed into the OAuth tokens or sent as a bearer header.
- **Lazy authentication.** Without credentials a host can connect, list tools and use the
  documentation tools; the first API tool call is answered with HTTP 401 and a
  `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=…` challenge, which makes the host open sign-in.
- **Sign-in.** The server is its own OAuth 2.1 authorization server (`/oauth/*`). The sign-in
  page asks for the API key once, checks it with the API (an unbilled request) and seals it
  into the tokens it issues (AES-256-GCM, key in `NBAI_TOKEN_KEY`). Nothing is stored
  server-side; revoke by resetting the key in the console. Claude identifies itself with its
  Client ID Metadata Document; other hosts use dynamic registration. PKCE is required.
- **Documentation follows the docs repository.** The server rebuilds its documentation index
  from `nb-public-docs` at start and whenever `main` moves (checked every 10 minutes), so
  documentation updates reach users within minutes and without a release.
- **Stateless.** One server instance per request, built from that request's credentials.
  Nothing about a caller is retained between requests.
- **Fixed egress address** `136.85.116.23` for calls to the NextBillion.ai API; allow it if
  your key has an IP allowlist.
- Running it yourself: `docker build -t nextbillion-mcp .` then
  `docker run -p 8080:8080 -e NBAI_PUBLIC_URL=https://your.host -e NBAI_TOKEN_KEY=… -e NBAI_DOCS_GITHUB_TOKEN=… nextbillion-mcp`.
  `node packages/server/dist/index.js --help` lists every environment variable. Infrastructure
  (Cloud Run, static egress, secrets, domain) is Terraform-managed in `nextbillion-infra`.

## Privacy Policy

`nextbillion-mcp` is a hosted MCP server operated by NextBillion.ai at https://mcp.nextbillion.io.
NextBillion.ai's privacy policy applies: https://nextbillion.ai/privacy.

**What is collected and sent.** When your AI client calls one of the API tools, the server
forwards that tool call's arguments (for example addresses, place names, coordinates, route
and map parameters) to `api.nextbillion.io` over HTTPS, authenticated with your API key, and
returns the API's response to your client unchanged. The server does not receive or
transmit anything else: no conversation content beyond the tool arguments, no files, no
device information.

**Your API key.** At sign-in your API key is sent to the server once, checked against the
NextBillion.ai API, and returned to your MCP host sealed inside encrypted tokens. On every
tool call the server decrypts the token in memory and uses the key for that request only. The
server keeps no database and stores no keys or tokens. Revoke access at any time by resetting
the key in the console; existing tokens stop working immediately.

**Documentation tools.** The four documentation tools (`search_documentation`,
`get_documentation`, `get_api_parameters` and `list_documentation_topics`) answer from an
index the server builds from NextBillion.ai's own documentation repository. They need no
sign-in and send nothing to the NextBillion.ai API.

**Logs and telemetry.** The server logs method, path, status and duration of each request —
never headers, bodies, keys or tokens. There is no analytics or crash reporting. Calls to the
API come from the server's fixed address `136.85.116.23` rather than from your machine.

**Third-party sharing and retention.** The server shares data with no one other than
NextBillion.ai. How NextBillion.ai uses and retains API request data is described in its
privacy policy at https://nextbillion.ai/privacy.

**Contact.** Privacy or support questions: support@nextbillion.ai.

## Repository layout

- `packages/server/` — the server (not published to npm since 0.4; it ships as a container).
  - `src/core/` — server assembly (spec compliance, error mapping)
  - `src/tools/` — one file per tool, grouped by product (places / routing / maps / docs)
  - `src/nbclient/` — shared NextBillion HTTP client (auth, timeout, retry, key redaction)
  - `src/http/` — Streamable HTTP app, bearer verification, the OAuth authorization server
  - `src/docs/` — documentation index: builder (from the docs repository), BM25 search, GitHub reader
  - `data/docs-index.json` — snapshot of the index built into the image, the fallback when
    the docs repository is unreachable at start
- `distributions/` — client setup: the Claude Code and Codex plugins (URL only, no code) and
  snippets for Cursor and manual configuration.
- `Dockerfile`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — image build; release tags push the image and
  deploy it to Cloud Run.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test          # unit + protocol conformance (no network, no key needed)
npm run build     # bundles the server into a single zero-dependency dist/index.js
NBAI_API_KEY=<key> npm run test:e2e   # live-API smoke tests
npm run build && NBAI_TOKEN_KEY=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))") \
  NBAI_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:8080 node packages/server/dist/index.js   # run it locally
```

Test a local build interactively with the MCP Inspector: start the server as above, then
`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` and connect to `http://localhost:8080` (transport
Streamable HTTP; use the browser sign-in, or set the header `Authorization: Bearer <key>`).
